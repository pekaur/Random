# Random
getting random value without using random method in python

We will use system time stamp to generate custom random numbers.
We will maintain two counters to keep track of the numbers generated less than 5 and greater than 5.
Also, we will use modulo and multiplication operations to generate a randomness difference which will be finally used to determine the next random value.
